# ðŸŒ´ Hawaii Climate Analysis & API

## Overview

This project performs a climate analysis of historical weather data from Honolulu, Hawaii. It is split into two parts:

1. **Climate Data Exploration & Visualization** (using Python, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Matplotlib)
2. **Development of a Climate API** (using Flask)

The analysis is based on a SQLite database containing weather station and measurement data. The API allows users to access precipitation and temperature data through various endpoints.
